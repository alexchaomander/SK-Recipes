    "1. **Setting up your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI Service key.** This lets you use this notebook like a playground of sorts.

    "2. **Getting a 🔥 kernel instantiated.** With your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI key you can then create a kernel to send instructions to. We've made it easy for you to use either OpenAI or Azure OpenAI. When using OpenAI, it will default to your using the `text-davinci-003` model; when you use Azure OpenAI there's an extra endpoint setting to consider — and in addition you're asked explicitly for the model you would like to use.\n",
