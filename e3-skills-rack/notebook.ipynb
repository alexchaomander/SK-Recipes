    "One of the ways that Semantic Kernel shines is the way you can easily reuse semantic functions. There's a simple folder structure we use that's described in greater detail [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/howto/semanticfunctions), but let's do a quick review of how Semantic Skills and Semantic Functions can be stored as conventional files.\n",

    "\n",
    "Multiple semantic functions can be shared as text files within enclosing folders to be packaged within a skill folder. This can be a little confusing, but there are skills and there are functions.
